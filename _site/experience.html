        <h3>Vision Systems, Inc.</h3>
<p>As a research and development intern at <a href="http://visionsystemsinc.com/">VSI</a> during the summer of 2016, I helped develop web application software for the Providence-based startup's package of terrain-modelling algorithms. Working in Django and JavaScript, I improved details of the user experience throughout the app, and incorporated responsive design for tablet screens. This included using the libraries <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers3</a> and <a href="https://cesiumjs.org/">Cesium.JS</a> to facilitate visual interactions where previously users had to interface with static forms. It was super rewarding to work on software in the real world for the first time, and as the summer progressed I felt that I was able to pick up new technologies and libraries more and more quickly as they were thrown my way.</p>

<h3>Virtual Reality Cave</h3>
<p>This past spring I worked alongside a graduate student collaborator in Brown's <a href="https://www.ccv.brown.edu/viz-yurt">Virtual Reality Cave</a>. Our project was to research methods for adapting single-screen 3D web content to 69-screen immersive VR experiences. Our eventual goal was to render any three.js scene in the cave and have it move responsively according a user's head movements, maintaining the three-dimensional illusion. The goal remains yet unrealized, due to complications with running Chrome-based browsers on older CentOS operating systems... but once back from Spain, I hope to continue my work in the Yurt.</p>

<h3>Artemis</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2015 I worked as a coordinator for <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/orgs/artemis/">The Artemis Project</a>, a five-week summer program geared towards rising high school girls. Along with three other Brown undergraduate women, I recruited and reviewed applications, redesigned the program website, developed and taught the curriculum, and organized guest speakers and field trips. The curriculum included web development in HTML & CSS as well as more intensive coding concepts in Python, including object-oriented programming and creating simple apps using a basic graphics library. Artemis, run and funded through Brown's CS department, is free for students, allowing us to empower many who are otherwise disadvantaged in tech fields because of class and gender. It was amazing to watch these young women grow in both conceptual understanding and self-confidence as the summer progressed.</p>
