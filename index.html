<p>Hello there! I'm a programmer and artist studying computer science at Brown University in Providence. At the moment I'm spending my junior fall abroad in Spain at the University of Granada. Prior to Brown, I attended Bard College at Simon's Rock in lieu of my senior year. I speak Java, JavaScript, Python, alto clef, and Spanish. In my free time, I cook stir-fries and work as an office assistant in Brown's music department.</p>
