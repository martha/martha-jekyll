<h3>Conjarra</h3>
<p><a href="https://quiet-eyrie-69994.herokuapp.com/">Conjarra</a> is a quick conjugation quiz app I threw together a few weekends ago, using Fred Jehle's awesome <a href="https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs">database</a> of Spanish verbs and conjugations. Conjarra's a functioning site but also an ongoing project for me. Future features I'm thinking of implementing include a timer clock, themed illustrations, and (reach goal) possibly utilizing ads to make money that could be donated to charity, Ã  la <a href="http://freerice.com/">freerice.com</a>.</p>
<p>Node.js | SQLite</p>

<h3>Unprocrastinator</h3>
<p>This past spring in my Web Apps class, my team of six created <a href="http://unprocrastinator.herokuapp.com/login">Unprocrastinator</a>, an enriched to-do list application. Our goal was to research, design, and develop an application with all the expected functionality of existing to-do list apps -- such as assigning tasks to specific dates, checking them off, and sorting them by tags -- but with a smarter twist. Unprocrastinator asks users to estimate how long each task took them, and by tracking the history of previously completed tasks, it offers an estimate of how long future tasks will take, helping students to improve their time management.</p>

<h3>Lonpos</h3>
<p><a href="http://lael-costa.squarespace.com/">Lael Costa</a> and I wrote a Python script to recursively solve the <a href="https://github.com/Lael-Costa/Lonpos">Lonpos puzzle</a> in its two-dimensional version. Coming soon: solutions to the tougher 3D pyramid puzzle, and a web app that stores the solutions in a database and visualizes them in Three.js.</p>
